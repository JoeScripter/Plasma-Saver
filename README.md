# Plasma-Saver

I am still mostly a beginner (3rd semester CS major).
This is a messy code (probably? I don't know, cause I am a beginner).

This little project of mine has mostly learning and sentimental value and isn't really practical.
Long story short, I got an old plasma tv, which could get damaged, if some stationary pixels are left for too long.
I am too lazy to keep switching the TV off.
